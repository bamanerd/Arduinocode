  Re-arranged the directory. Initial INO didn't work, and I decided that
  subdirs for non-catastrophic tests was apropos. Things to test and CAN
  fail can belong therein.

zarboz 20150524.2305:
  Changed out master branch with Exp branch including code for i2c display
  introduced coding for digipot part #X9C103SIZ 100 ohm digital pot 
  pots are intended to be run in series meaning 1 step will equal 2 ohms
  currently is coded for use of acs712 soon to be overhauld for an lm4040
  to gain a higher accuracy rate of reading.

 Decided to make branch for PWM control
 todo: Determine what steps of 10k ohm pot = what voltage on 3s lipo
 impliment math to determine ohms law of desired voltage for watt output
